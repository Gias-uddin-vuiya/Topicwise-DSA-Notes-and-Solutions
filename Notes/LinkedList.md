## LinkedList Notes

A **Linked List** is a linear data structure where elements (nodes) are linked together using pointers. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not store elements in contiguous memory locations, allowing for dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertions and deletions.

🔹 **Types of Linked Lists**

1. **Singly Linked List** - Each node has a `data` field and a `next` pointer pointing to the next node.

2. **Doubly Linked List** - Each node has a `data` field, a `next` pointer (to the next node), and a `prev` pointer (to the previous node).

3. **Circular Linked List** - The last node points back to the first node, forming a circular structure.

📌 **Why Use Linked Lists?**

✅ Dynamic memory allocation (no fixed size like arrays)

✅ Efficient insertions/deletions (O(1) for head/tail insertions)

✅ Useful for implementing stacks, queues, and graphs.

🚀 **How to Learn Linked Lists Effectively.**

 Follow this structured learning path:

1️⃣ **Learn the Basics (Theory + Implementation).**

- Understand **how nodes are linked** and how pointers work.

- **Implement a Singly Linked** List from scratch (insert, delete, traverse).

- **Implement Doubly and Circular Linked Lists** for deeper understanding.

📖 **Resources:**

- [CS50 Linked Lists Lecture](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/notes/5/)



2️⃣ **Solve Beginner Problems on LeetCode:**

Start with `easy` problems before moving to `medium` and `hard`.

💡 **Beginner Problems:**

1. [Reverse-linked-list](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)

2. [Merge-two-sorted-lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/)

3. [Remove-duplicates-from-sorted-list](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-list/description/)


3️⃣ **Master Advanced Linked List Problems.**

Once comfortable, move to **advanced** problems involving recursion, cycle detection, and two-pointer techniques.

💡 **Advanced Problems:**

- [Linked-list-cycle](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/description/)

- [Add-two-numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/description/)

- [Reverse-nodes-in-k-group](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-nodes-in-k-group/description/)


4️⃣ **Implement Real-World Applications:**

To strengthen your understanding, apply linked lists in:

- **Stacks & Queues** (linked list implementation)

- **LRU Cache** (doubly linked list + hash map)

- **Graphs** (adjacency list representation)


5️⃣ **Read a Book on Data Structures:**
Since you're serious about **DSA and competitive programming,** a book like: 📘 **"Introduction to Algorithms" by Cormen (CLRS)**
